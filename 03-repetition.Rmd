## Looping

You can loop a block of code like this:

```
loop do
  play 70
  sleep 1
end
```

The `do` and `end` act like brackets. They enclose code blocks in many situations.

Here is a composition by some pupils a few years ago.

## `x.times`

```
3.times do
  play 70
  sleep 1
end
```

You can *nest* do/end blocks:

```
3.times do
  play 70
  sleep 1
  
  5.times do
    play 71
    sleep 1
  end
end
```

Notice there are two `end`s because there are two `do`s, like pairs of brackets.


## `loop`

A simple loop block:

```
loop do
  play 70
  sleep 1
end
```

## `play_pattern_timed`

```
use_bpm 40

play_pattern_timed [:cs4, :e4, :cs4], [0.3, 0.3, 0.2], release: 0.2
```

## Chords

`play [:cs5, :e5, :gs5]`

is the same as:

`play chord(:cs5, :minor)`
