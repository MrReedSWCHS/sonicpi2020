The menu pages on the left are written consecutively. The actual content of this website takes 30 mins ish, plus time for you to experiment. We will meet again at 10am on 17th June to discuss next steps, philosophy and Q+A 1.1 Help me! I’m live on Zoom chat if there’s an issue. And there’s a lovely tutorial in the program itself. 1.2 Install Please install now so that you can try it out as we go: https://sonic-pi.net Sonic Pi runs on Mac, Windows and Linux, but unfortunately not tablets/mobiles. 1.3 If you’re on a Mac… Since it’s not authorised through the App Store, installing can be a bit of a pain. You might have to open System Preferences and open Security and Privacy. Towards the bottom of this window, you should be able to click on Open Anyway. You should only have to do this the first time you run the software. "],

They enclose code blocks in many situations. Here is a composition by some pupils a few years ago. 4.2 x.times 3.times do play 70 sleep 1 end You can nest do/end blocks: 3.times do play 70 sleep 1 5.times do play 71 sleep 1 end end Notice there are two ends because there are two dos, like pairs of brackets. 4.3 loop A simple loop block: loop do play 70 sleep 1 end 4.4 play_pattern_timed use_bpm 40 play_pattern_timed [:cs4, :e4, :cs4], [0.3, 0.3, 0.2], release: 0.2 4.5 Chords play [:cs5, :e5, :gs5] is the same as: play chord(:cs5, :minor) "],

It’s short but with lots of musical implications. 5.1.1 Stimulus 5.1.2 Example compositions 5.2 Cover versions I did find the Shape of You! It’s brilliant. The code is here. Perhaps you can have a go at tidying it up and using some play_pattern_timed and other strategies to make it more readable or flexible? Here’s another cover version from a few years back. "],
