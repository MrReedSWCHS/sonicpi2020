## Help me!

I'm live on Zoom chat if there's an issue. And there's a lovely tutorial in the program itself.

## Handout {-}

Handout document and summary of advantages/disadvantages [here](https://reedmusic.net/handout.html).

## Install {-}

<p class="go">Please install now so that you can try it out as we go: https://sonic-pi.net</p>

Sonic Pi runs on Mac, Windows and Linux, but unfortunately not tablets/mobiles.

## If you're on a Mac... {-}

Since it's not authorised through the App Store, installing can be a bit of a pain.

You might have to open **System Preferences** and open **Security and Privacy**. Towards the bottom of this window, you should be able to click on **Open Anyway**. You should only have to do this the first time you run the software.
